# First-Year-Robotics-Challenge
Pololu 3pi Robotics Challenge

The programme here was written for a pololu 3pi robot with two LDR's attached.
The code can essentially be broken down into the three challenges of the course and a transition between each challenge.
The first challenge was to locate a light source (ie. a torch) and approach it until a certain light intensity is detected.
After that it then should detect a line underneath it and follow the line until it reaches the slope of a see-saw and detects the incline.
Once the incline is detected it then needs to balance the see-saw by moving back and fourth accross the see-saw until the accelerometer parameters are satisfied so it knows it is balanced. It then holds the position for a short period and then the course is complete.
